        The Ruby on Rails development project utilizes the Rails framework and
        the Ruby programming language to build web applications. The project's
        data is stored and managed using the PostgreSQL database. To enhance the
        project's functionality, several gems have been implemented, including
        Devise for user authentication, Pundit for authorization, pg for
        PostgreSQL connectivity, faker for generating fake data, will_paginate
        for pagination, and will_paginate-bootstrap4 for styling pagination.
        These gems provide additional features and functionality to the project,
        making it more efficient and user-friendly.

        <strong>Project Detail:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been responsible for upgrading a legacy Rails application from
        version <strong>3.0.2 to 6.0</strong>. This involved a comprehensive
        analysis of the codebase, identifying and resolving compatibility
        issues, and testing the new version thoroughly to ensure seamless
        performance. I have also been responsible for daily fixes and
        improvements to the application, addressing bugs, and enhancing its
        features to meet the evolving needs of the business.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to the Rails upgrade, I have containerized three different
        applications using <strong>Docker</strong>, allowing for easy deployment
        and scaling of these applications in a consistent and efficient manner.
        I have worked with the development team to ensure that the applications
        are designed to be containerized from the start, making the process
        seamless and less time-consuming.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, I have started working on <strong>Nginx</strong>, a
        high-performance web server, to optimize the performance and reliability
        of the applications. This has involved configuring Nginx to serve static
        assets, handling SSL certificates, and managing the reverse proxy
        server.

    <p><strong>Ruby on Rails + Flutter (Mobile Application) Developer</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Project Name:</strong> Web & Mobile Entertainment App</p>
  <p><strong>Project Description:</strong><br />
  This project aims to develop a user-friendly mobile application that caters to movie and music enthusiasts. It will leverage Flutter for a cross-platform native feel, Ruby on Rails for a robust and efficient backend, and RESTful APIs for secure communication between the app and server. Key features include:</p>

  <p><strong>Movie Exploration:</strong><br />
  • Browse a curated collection of movies.<br />
  • Filter and search for movies by genre, release date, rating, or keywords.<br />
  • View detailed movie information, including synopsis, cast, crew, and trailers.<br />
  • Add movies to a watchlist for future reference.</p>

  <p><strong>Music Library:</strong><br />
  • Access a comprehensive music library with various genres and artists.<br />
  • Search for specific songs or artists.<br />
  • Create custom playlists for personalized listening experiences.</p>

  <p><strong>Playback Functionality:</strong><br />
  • Seamlessly play movies and music within the app using integrated players.<br />
  • Implement playback controls (play, pause, rewind, fast forward, volume).<br />
  • Consider offline playback capabilities (downloadable content) for movies and music, depending on client requirements and content licensing agreements.</p>

  <p><strong>Technology Stack:</strong><br />
  • <strong>Frontend:</strong> Flutter (for a cross-platform native experience on iOS and Android)<br />
  • <strong>Backend:</strong> Ruby on Rails (for a scalable and efficient backend API)<br />
  • <strong>API Design:</strong> RESTful APIs (for secure and standardized communication between app and server)</p>

  <p><strong>Project Phases:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>1. Planning and Requirement Gathering:</strong><br />
  • Conduct thorough discussions with the client to understand their specific needs, target audience, and desired functionalities.<br />
  • Create a detailed project scope document outlining features, user stories, and timelines.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Backend Development (Ruby on Rails):</strong><br />
  • Set up the Ruby on Rails environment.<br />
  • Develop a robust database schema to store movie, music, and user data.<br />
  • Implement RESTful APIs for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movies, music, playlists, and user accounts (if applicable).<br />
  • Integrate authentication and authorization mechanisms (optional, depending on client requirements).<br />
  • Implement security measures to protect user data and API endpoints.</p>

  <p><strong>3. Frontend Development (Flutter):</strong><br />
  • Set up the Flutter development environment.<br />
  • Design a user-friendly and intuitive UI that aligns with the client's brand guidelines.<br />
  • Develop screens for movie browsing, music exploration, playback controls, and user management (if applicable).<br />
  • Integrate with the backend APIs for data fetching, user actions, and playback management.<br />
  • Implement offline functionality (if required) for downloaded movies and music.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Testing and Deployment:</strong><br />
  • Conduct thorough unit testing and integration testing for both frontend and backend components.<br />
  • Deploy the backend API to a suitable hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).<br />
  • Deploy the frontend app, follow platform-specific guidelines (App Store Connect for iOS, Google Play Store for Android).</p>

  <p><strong>5. Maintenance and Support:</strong><br />
  • Provide ongoing maintenance and support to address bugs, implement new features, and adapt to changing requirements.</p>

  <p><strong>Additional Considerations:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>• Content Management System (CMS):</strong> Consider integrating a CMS (e.g., Strapi) to allow the client to easily manage and update content without requiring code changes.<br />
  • <strong>Third-Party APIs:</strong> Explore potential integration with third-party APIs for movie trailers, music streaming services (if applicable), or user authentication (e.g., Firebase Authentication).<br />
  • <strong>Scalability and Performance:</strong> Design the architecture to accommodate future growth in user base and data volume. Utilize caching mechanisms and optimize database queries for optimal performance.</p>
